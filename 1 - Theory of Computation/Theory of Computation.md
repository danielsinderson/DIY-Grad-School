## Notes
---------
*(rewritten and paraphrased from pg. 6)*

Programming languages have two tasks. The first is to instruct a computer to compute things. The second is to provide a language within which humans organize their thoughts about processes. To accomplish the first, a language has some method for compiling down to machine code. To accomplish the second, a language has primitives (the atoms of operations and data), means for combining primitives, and means for abstracting over combined primitives so they can be manipulated as single units.
