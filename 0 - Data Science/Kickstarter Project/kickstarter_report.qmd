# Goals of the Report
My goal with this report is two-fold. First, I want to get a feeling for how often RPGs get funded and for how much. Second, I want to practice data analysis with a proper project. 

# The Dataset
The dataset that I'll be using for the analysis was created by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). It contains data on Kickstarter projects from 2009 to 2023.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

ks1 <- read_tsv("0 - Data Science/38050-0001-Data.tsv")
glimpse(ks1)
```
