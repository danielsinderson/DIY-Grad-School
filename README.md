# Why?
I've designed my own course of advanced study for two reasons. The first is that a standard PhD program isn't an option: fellowships don't pay enough to support a family. The second is that my ideal course of study straddles the line between pure and applied mathematics and theoretical computer science in a way that's difficult to capture within a traditional graduate program.

For course texts I tried to balance readability, coverage, and the availability/price. It's extraordinary how many of these texts are made available for free by the author(s).

# Guidelines
- 14 hours per week
- Readings will be accompanied by substantial notes on the topics covered, completion of 50% or more of the provided exercises, and the creation of flashcards for spaced repetition
