# Why?
I've designed my own course of advanced study for two reasons.
The first is that a standard PhD program isn't an option: fellowships don't pay enough to support a family. The second is that my ideal course of study is interdisciplinary in a way that's difficult to capture within a traditional graduate program.

## Secondary Curriculum
During the month long breaks between terms I will be reading through a selection of topics in social theory, complex systems, biology, and computer science for fun and motivation. I'll decide on these as the breaks come up and add them here.

## Texts
- **Primary Curriculum**: 
	- **Abstract Linear Algebra**: *Linear Algebra Done Right* by Sheldon Axler
	- **Real Analysis**: *Understanding Analysis* by Stephen Abbott
	- **Functional Programming**: *The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs* by Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Julie Sussman
	- **Algebra**: *Algebra: Chapter 0* by Paolo Aluffi
	- **Analysis**: *Measure, Integration, and Real Analysis* by Sheldon Axler
	- **Dynamical Systems**: *Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos with Applications* by Steven Strogatz
	- **Topology**: *Topology: A Categorical Approach* by Tai-Danae Bradley, Tyler Bryson, and John Terilla
	- **Lie Theory**: *Naive Lie Theory* by John Stillwell
	- **Automata Theory**: *Applications of Automata Theory and Algebra* by John Rhodes
	- **Algebraic Topology**: *Algebraic Topology* by Allen Hatcher
	- **Manifolds**: *Introduction to Smooth Manifolds* by John M. Lee
	- **Multiagent Systems**: *Multiagent Systems: Algorithmic, Game-Theoretic, and Logical Foundations* by Yoav Shoham and Kevin Leyton-Brown
- **Secondary Curriculum**: 
	- *Functional Programming in Lean*

For course texts I tried to balance readability, coverage, and the availability/price. It's extraordinary how many of these texts are made available for free by the author(s).

# Schedule and Guidelines
- Schedule
	- **Winter**: January - February
	- **Spring**: April - May
	- **Summer**: July - August (for review courses)
	- **Fall**: October - November
