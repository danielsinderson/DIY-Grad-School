# Why?
I've designed my own course of advanced study for two reasons.
The first is that a standard PhD program isn't an option: fellowships don't pay enough to support a family. The second is that my ideal course of study is interdisciplinary in a way that's difficult to capture within a traditional graduate program.


# Goals and Outline
My goals for the program are to solidify my pure math fundamentals and then move on to a variety of topics in applied mathematics, mathematical modeling, and theoretical computer science, with the goal being to move into an approach to these topics from a higher structures point of view later on.

My ultimate aim is to contribute to application research and pedagogy rather than to advance research in the fields themselves.
