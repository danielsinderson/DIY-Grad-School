## Notes
---------
*(rewritten and paraphrased from pg. 6)*

Programming languages have two tasks. The first is to instruct a computer to compute things. The second is to provide a language within which humans organize their thoughts about processes. To accomplish the first, a language has some method for compiling down to machine code. To accomplish the second, a language has primitives (the atoms of operations and data), means for combining primitives, and means for abstracting over combined primitives so they can be manipulated as single units.

------------
*(types of processes)*

Three common kinds of processes that procedures generate are linear recursive (heavy memory useage on the interpreter), iterative (requires more state variables and can require procedures that are less readable), and tree recursive processes (powerful for computing over hierarchical data, but often far too computationally expensive otherwise).
